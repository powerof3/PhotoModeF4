# Dependency inventory

Target: Fallout 4 **1.11.240.0**, matching F4SE and Address Library database.
The following git dependencies are submodules, not branch downloads:

| Project | Commit | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| libxse/commonlibf4 | 7c8c6f8a349ac85abf6fc8a7e5a71732d9339954 | Game/F4SE ABI, official plugin rule |
| libxse/commonlib-shared | 29fbdb0e2dc548c9ab22f6964981d75090dc9094 | Recorded recursive gitlink; REL/REX |
| powerof3/imgui | 55dc9c8badfbd7464cff5da4639b249b91cca225 | Original custom text shadows and dynamic fonts |
| powerof3/CLibUtil | e1eabe6a063a3abcd3e5b1e739e6ca842fc9a67c | Original INI, RNG, string helpers |
| xmake-io/xmake-repo | 56066557b57047b65d60d354bdb9f80e7b878704 | Package recipes and archive checksums |

CommonLib Shared main 79bccb6430237eac766c7e45c9c7a0523bdf92e4 is **not** used:
no reason to override CommonLibF4's tested API pairing was established.
The CommonLibF4 version header names 1.11.240 as latest; that does not verify
Photo Mode's hook instruction offsets or game behavior.

Build tool: XMake 3.0.3, upstream commit de7aca41098886112f693dbbb590c2facf7fa533.
Windows CI installs the fixed release through a commit-pinned official setup action.
MSVC v143 / VS2022 and Windows SDK come from windows-2022. Hosted images receive
updates, so the compiler/SDK patch versions are not byte-for-byte pinned; CI prints
the selected compiler. C++23, MD runtime, static dependency libraries, releasedbg.
No game directory is used during compilation.

Package archives: DirectXTex 2025.07 (MIT), FreeType 2.13.3 (FTL/GPL dual license;
select FTL), RapidFuzz v3.3.3 (MIT), SRELL 4.063 (BSD-2-Clause),
unordered_dense v4.8.1 (MIT), spdlog v1.16.0 (MIT, compiled with std::format and
wchar support by CommonLib Shared). Recipes and their expected archive hashes
are fixed by the xmake-repo gitlink. CMake is an internal third-party package
builder only, not the Photo Mode build system. The Windows-generated
`xmake-requires.lock` is committed: requested transitive tool versions are CMake
3.31.6, Meson 1.12.1, Ninja 1.13.2, pkgconf 2.5.1 and Python 3.14.3.
XMake may satisfy build-tool probes with compatible preinstalled host tools;
those host binaries follow windows-2022 image updates, not package archive pins.
The linked library versions and checked archive hashes remain fixed.
Do not update recipes or git dependencies implicitly for a release.

Original source baseline: powerof3/PhotoModeF4 d47942eadd0004f9266027ad23ea49c49393f955,
identical to this repository's starting commit. No experimental Photo Mode fork
was incorporated. The original CMake/vcpkg integration was removed only after Windows XMake
compilation, linking, export checks and packaging succeeded in CI.

`scripts/dependency_sources.json` records the exact six source archive URLs and
SHA256 values used for the corresponding-source bundle. Git submodule sources
(including Shared) and package recipes are included recursively without Git
metadata or optional sample font binaries. CI source packaging verifies every
archive checksum and fails if matching source cannot be retrieved.
